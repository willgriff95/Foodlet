# Project 3


### Aim:
to work in a group to produce a MEAN stack app, including an API with all RESTFUL actions.


### Technologies used:
* HTML5
* SCSS
* Javascript
* MongoDB
* Node.js
* AngularJS
* Git
* Github
* Webpack
* Heroku
* Google Maps and Directions API

### The site:
We have created a food waste sharing app, using Google Maps. On login, users are taken to a map based on their location, where they can see markers indicating shared food in their local area. Users can then click on the item to see more details and to request collection.


### The process:
1. Our first step was to brainstorm ideas for our app. We then narrowed it down to 2 ideas and established exactly what features each would have, and the third party APIs we could incorporate.
2. Once we had picked the food waste sharing idea, we made a list of all the features and quickly sketched some wireframes. We then made some high-fidelity wireframes in Adobe XD and a map of the page routes in Balsamiq, as well as a Trello board of all the features, adding labels and group members responsible.

3. We decided that the MVP would be a basic site with full RESTFUL resources for the food model. The first stage of our coding was to create the files we expected to need and installing all our dependencies.

4. We produced the back-end code, using insomnia to test, before starting on any front-end code. We added tests for all MVP pages. We also added basic styling at this point to give us more of a visual guide.

5. Having achieved the MVP much more quickly than we expected, we started to develop the other features. First of these was Google Maps, which we added to our index map page. However, we thought some users might prefer a list view, so we added a toggle for the two different views.

6. The next features to be added were Filestack, which allows users to upload images from their device, and a request function. We limited all functions so that users can request an item only once, can edit and delete only their own items, and only item owners can accept requests.





### Issues faced:
* Adding multiple map markers
* Adding a route mapping function
* Adding Filestack


### Future plans:
* Adding nodemailer so that when users request or accept an item, they receive an email notification.
