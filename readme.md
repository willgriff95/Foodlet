# Project 3


### Aim:
to work in a group to produce a MEAN stack app, including an API with all RESTFUL actions.


### Technologies used:
* HTML5
* SCSS
* Javascript
* MongoDB
* Node.js
* AngularJS
* Git
* Github
* Webpack
* Heroku
* Google Maps and Directions API

### The site:
We have created a food waste sharing app, using Google Maps. On login, users are taken to a map based on their location, where they can see markers indicating shared food in their local area. Users can then click on the item to see more details and to request collection.


### The process:
1. Our first step was to brainstorm ideas for our app. We then narrowed it down to 2 ideas and established exactly what features each would have, and the third party APIs we could incorporate.
2. Once we had picked the food waste sharing idea, we made a list of all the features and quickly sketched some wireframes. We then made some high-fidelity wireframes in Adobe XD and a map of the page routes in Balsamiq, as well as a Trello board of all the features, adding labels and group members responsible.

(add adobe, balsamiq, trello screenshots)

3. We decided that the MVP would be a basic site with full RESTFUL resources for the food model. The first stage of our coding was to create the files we expected to need and installing all our dependencies.
