# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #3: A MEAN Stack App

### Overview

Your instructors will partner you with other classmates to design and collaboratively build a MEAN stack app of your own design.

- **M**ongo - For the database
- **E**xpress - For the web-framework
- **A**ngular - Angular(1) for the client-side framework
- **N**ode - For the server-side language

This is the _most realistic_ stack that you have worked on during the course and will prepare you for working in the industry where the MEAN stack setup is still very popular.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It is a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself. However, it is very likely thank you are going to find yourself working in a teams throughout your development careers so **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

### Technical Requirements

* **Carefully plan wireframes** as a team _before starting to code_
* **Carefully plan Model schemas*** as a team _before starting to code_
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a Git on Github
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible

#### Server-side

Your app must:

* **Use Mongo, Node & Express** to build a server-side API
* **Your API must have at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Your API should include **all RESTFUL actions** for at least one of those models
* Include **authentication** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document**, however don't go crazy! You need to manage your time effectively...
* **Include automated tests** for at least one resource

#### Client-side

* **Use Angular** to build a front-end that consumes your API
* **Use SCSS instead of CSS**
* **Use Webpack & Yarn** to manage your dependencies and compile your source code

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A handmade Angular front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
	* Explanations of the **technologies** used
   	* A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
   	* **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
   	* Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_
